    <h2>relative - using top, bottom, left and right to indicate how far to move the element from its orignal position
        in normal flow</h2>

    <p class="relativeElement">
        this is the second para, that set postion: relative - away from its original position. 
        top and left set up px space

            is often a cute (or maybe just silly) little object that you might put on a display shelf in your house.
